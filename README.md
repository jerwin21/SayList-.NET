**Saylist**
This was originally inteded to serve as the middle man between a web app that I was going to write using .NET and the spotify developer API.
I did not spend enough time reading the Spotify Developer API documentation, and ended up with most of the API written after realizing that it really wasn't an ideal design,
and things would be better off all in the client. But it was a fun exercise, and it has allowed me to put some c# on my github. 

**If you want to run this your self**
you will need to register your own app and get your own client_id and client_secret from Spotify. Can be done here https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
I utilized .NET user secrets to hide my id and secret, but you could use appsettings.json
